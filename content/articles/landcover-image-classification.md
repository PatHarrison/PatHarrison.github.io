### Summary
Landcover assessment using a support vector machine (SVM) near the Waiparous Alberta.
This was an assignment for my Bachelors of applied technology in Geographic Information Systems.
The task was to find satellite imagery of the study area (I used Planet Labs imagery) and use
and compare supervised machine learning algorithms to classify landcover.
