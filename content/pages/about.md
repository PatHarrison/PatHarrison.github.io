## Who Am I?
I am a GIS Technologist with two years of experience in software automation testing and QA/QC.
I specialize in automating GIS workflows and designing spatial databases, combining technical skills with a strong interest in land management and data analytics.

I adapt quickly to new challenges and prioritize continuous learning.
GIS spans many industries, and staying effective requires moving beyond fundamentals to understand systems at a deeper level.
I pursue this through formal education, self-study, workshops, and on-the-job experience.

## Current Pursuits

I am currently enrolled at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology finishing my Bachelors of Applied Technology in Geographic Information Systems.
I am working as a GIS Technologist with [Canada West Land](https://canadawestland.com/).
In this position I am pursing an excellence in workflow automations with Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) and integrations of artificial intelligence in GIS.


## Background

My experience spans astrophysics, software testing, and GIS, giving me a strong foundation in both analytical thinking and technical implementation.
My testing background sharpened my attention to detail, while my GIS work focuses on automation, data integrity, and problem-solving with spatial data.
