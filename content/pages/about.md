## Who I Am
I am a GIS Technologist with two years of experience in software automation testing and QA/QC.
I specialize in automating GIS workflows and designing spatial databases, combining technical skills with a strong interest in land management and data analytics.

I adapt quickly to new challenges and prioritize continuous learning.
GIS spans many industries, and staying effective requires moving beyond fundamentals to understand systems at a deeper level.
I pursue this through formal education, self-study, workshops, and on-the-job experience.

## Background

My experience spans astrophysics, software testing, and GIS, giving me a strong foundation in both analytical thinking and technical implementation.
My testing background sharpened my attention to detail, while my GIS work focuses on automation, data integrity, and problem-solving with spatial data.


### Python

I have over six years of experience using Python across multiple domains, including geospatial analysis, computational physics, data modeling, and automated software testing.

### Geospatial Analysis

Experience automating workflows, managing spatial data, and supporting analysis through scripting and database design.

### QA/QC

Strong background in quality assurance and quality control, with an emphasis on validation, repeatability, and reliable data pipelines.
